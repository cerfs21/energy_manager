### Energy Manager

This project aims at improving the energy management natively provided by commercial devices in the field of solar thermal and photovoltaic power solutions.

The proposed application will ultimately deliver the following services and functions:
+ collect, store and display data from sensors such as solar and thermal probes, device counters;
+ control devices such as solar pumps and valves, heating system, electrical inverters and battery chargers;
+ collect external data such as weather forecasts[^first] and the number of people expected in the building;
+ use these control systems and internal/external data to optimize the production and storage of solar thermal and photovoltaic energy;
+ provide tools to cross-analyze collected data, power management decisons and results obtained;
+ help with energy system sizing and improve decision algorithms.

This project also intends to implement state-of-art methods and tools:
+ Scrum and CI/CD approaches and tools;
- container-based microservice architecture (data flows, data storage, device control, user interface...);
* artificial intelligence such as Machine Learning (data analysis, decision algorithms...).


[^first]: a quite sunny weather forecast in summer would typically result in:
+ limiting the use of carbon energies to produce hot water the night before;
+ using the solar pump for the sole purpose of cooling solar panels the next day.
